# Week 4 Structure :muscle:

**_Before session starts:_**

- _Take attendance_
- _Check for social media permissions (let participants know that we'll be taking photos of the session and using them on social media - if they wpuld not like us to use their picture on social media, then they should find a moment to let a mentor know)_

**Recap last week** :turtle:

- In particular recap **functions**
- Perhaps discuss people's solutions to [last week's JS challenges](https://hackmd.io/445IJxgQQ1S-inNrt7fndw)

**freeCodeCamp** :tent:

- Pair work
- Ideally, participants will be familiar with data types, `if` statements and `for` loops by this stage - but no worries if not
- If anyone's already finished with 'Basic JavaScript', recommend them to help others. Or, they could work on 'Basic Data Structures' or 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' if they're paired with someone at the same level

**Codewars** :fist:

- Intro and signup
- [Codewars tips and jargon busting](https://hackmd.io/ZX34SmmuTsKvowG4TJkfOQ) slides

**Mob programme an 8kyu kata** :family:

- Suggestions:

- https://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-a-number-to-a-string
- https://www.codewars.com/kata/string-repeat

**Kata session** :ocean:

- Keep working on 8kyu katas
- Try and have people working in groups, with a mentor each?
- Then, if people in a group feel like they're ready, can pair up and split off and work on kata without a mentor overseeing
- Similarly, if people feel they're adrift, they can move back to freeCodeCamp and get comfortable with the JS :smile:

**Homework**: Continue the pre-reqs! :rocket:
