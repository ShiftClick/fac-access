# Week 1: Toolkit and HTML :seedling:

**_Before session starts:_**
- Make sure that short course Gitter room is open, and that attendees have joined.
- Pass around attendance sheet.
- Check for social media permissions (let participants know that we'll be taking photos of the session and using them on social media - if they would not like us to use their picture on social media, then they should find a moment to let a mentor know).
- Attendees should've received an email with instructions to sign up for Github, Gitter, freeCodeCamp and Codepen, but it's good to still double check with people as they arrive (there should be a slide with details that you can display as people come in).

There are speaker notes, where necessary, in the slide deck - you'll just need to hit `s` to access them. They're also pasted below in italics.

### Course structure with suggested timings:

(These have been left fairly flexible, as each group is different!)

- #### Welcome to FAC + intro to the short course (10mins)
    - _While people are arriving, make sure they're signed up for Github, Gitter, freeCodeCamp and Codepen. Also pass round the attendance sheet._

- #### Intro to web development (5-10mins)

- #### How to use freeCodeCamp (5mins)
    -  _Give a quick guide around freeCodeCamp - explain the layout of the challenge window, the different sections, and how to complete a challenge. Perhaps 'mob programme' the first challenge of 'Basic HTML and HTML5' together, before letting students carry on with the challenges by themselves for 20-30mins._

- #### Work on freeCodeCamp (20-30mins)

- #### Using Dev Tools (5-10mins)
    - _Show students how to inspect a webpage, and how to use the dev tools for seeing the HTML under the hood. It can then be fun to delete the HTML for the Google logo, or to mess around and do some editing._

- #### Intro to Pair Programming (5mins)
    - _Explain that we'll be covering other pair programming methods in the coming weeks._

- #### Intro to Codepen (5mins)
    - _Run through how to use Codepen - including how to fork someone else's pen. Show this basic example pen, if need be: https://codepen.io/charlielafosse/pen/pGVZQb_

- #### Project Work (30-45mins)
    - _You might want to let pairs spread out and sit elsewhere if the classroom is cramped. Try to stop them at 8.25 so you have time to wrap up._
    - _Check one last time that you've got everyone's attendance (there may have been latecomers)._
