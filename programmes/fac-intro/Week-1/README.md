# Week 1 Structure :seedling:

**_Before session starts:_**

- _Take attendance_
- _Check for social media permissions (let participants know that we'll be taking photos of the session and using them on social media - if they would not like us to use their picture on social media, then they should find a moment to let a mentor know)_

**Intro** :wave:

- FAC intro
- Intro course + curriculum for next 4 weeks - [Hackmd here](https://hackmd.io/SyTk1rWaSK2Yil-ilkWKMA)

**Sign up to Github, freeCodeCamp** :boom:

- Students should have already got themselves signed up. Perhaps those who have can quickly help out those who haven't, at the beginning.

**Add everyone to Gitter room** :family:

- Encourage students to use the Gitter room in between sessions to ask any questions and share resources

#### Intro to web pages + HTML

- Work through 'Basic HTML and HTML5' section
- Let participants initially work individually, and gauge the different experience levels

**Codepen** :pencil:

- Signup and how to use

**Introduce examples of tribute page** :dizzy:

- [freeCodeCamp Tribute Page project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page/)
- Show off a few examples, and then pick through and talk about some of the HTML and how it's structured.

- Pair programming!
- Two people working on one tribute page together

**Homework** :apple:
