# Week 1 Structure :seedling:

**_Before session starts:_**
- Make sure that short course Gitter room is open
- _Take attendance_
- _Check for social media permissions (let participants know that we'll be taking photos of the session and using them on social media - if they would not like us to use their picture on social media, then they should find a moment to let a mentor know)_
- Remind early arrivers to sign up for Github, Gitter, FreeCodeCamp and Codepen (there should be a slide with details that you can display as people come in)
