**Homework**: Continue freeCodeCamp Javascript (v long)! :apple: 

### Week 4 structure

---

- **Recap JS so far and Functions**
    - perhaps inc. discussing people's solutions to [last week's JS challenges](https://hackmd.io/445IJxgQQ1S-inNrt7fndw)
- **Pair work on [FCC JS section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)**
    - in order to familiarise students with the ideas they'll need for tackling Codewars
    - Try to see if everyone has at least got as far as 'Golf Code' before moving onto Codewars (would've covered arrays and if statements by this stage) (would be good to try and cover for loops too?)
- H a l f w a y (bit earlier)
- **Intro to Codewars + signup**
- **[Codewars tips and jargon busting](https://hackmd.io/ZX34SmmuTsKvowG4TJkfOQ)**
- **Mob programme an 8kyu kata**
    - ideas: 
    - https://www.codewars.com/collections/training-js-series-for-javascript-beginner-myjinxin2015
    - https://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-a-number-to-a-string
    - https://www.codewars.com/kata/string-repeat 
- **Table groups with a mentor each**:
    - Keep working on 8kyu katas
    - If people in a group feel like they're ready, can pair up and split off and work on kata without a mentor overseeing :muscle: 
    - Similarly, if people feel they're adrift, they can move back to [FCC JS section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and get comfortable with the JS :smile: 

- **Homework**: Continue the pre-reqs! :rocket:
