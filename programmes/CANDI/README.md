# City and Islington Access Course

## Overview

This is roughly the course that was delivered with the first group of students at CANDI. We worked with BTEC Computing students, so they already had some strong concepts, and had done most of their coding with Python.

The students were keen to create an app, so we worked on creating a relatively simple To Do list app, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

NB: This programme may need to be adapted a fair bit if used with a group with less experience of coding - In particular the JS concepts such as array manipulation were picked up very fast as they could link them with their learning about lists in Python.

### Week 7 - DOM manipulation

#### Part 1

- go through [DOM manipulation workshop](../../workshops/dom-manipulation)

#### Part 2

- demo how to use DOM manipulation to make the to-do page interactive (link up the form and submit button to add items into the UL, give each one a button to mark it as done and a button to delete it)
- 40 mins in pairs to add JS to the HTML/CSS to-do apps

#### Homework

- Continue basic JS on fCC

### Week 8 - Managing State

#### Part 1

- introduce the idea of keeping state in JS and rendering it into the DOM
- demo using an array of to-do items, using objects with title and status
- discuss what functions will be needed to manipulate the list
  - add a to-do item
  - remove a to-do item
  - toggle an item as done / not done
  - sort the list by status (done / not done)
- students in pairs to write the necessary JS functions to manipulate the array

#### Part 2

- discuss how to link the logic with the DOM
- students in pairs to write a render function that puts the state into the page
- 20mins share and discuss
