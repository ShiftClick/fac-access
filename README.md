## How to use

This is a repository of materials that have been used or trialled to support potential applicants **before the point of application**. The aim is to help support a more diverse pool of applicants to reach the application stage.

### Workshops
The [workshops](workshops) folder contains sessions designed to be led during a meetup, however some may also be suitable for applicants to go through independently. These are stand-alone workshops and each one can be used independently of another.

### Programmes
The [programmes](programmes) folder contains grouped programmes of content, structured to be delivered to the same group over a period of time. The first of these is to build a simple To Do app, and was trialled with students at City and Islington College.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed - any materials that have been used to support people in their journey towards being coders can be added to this repo. Materials should be **for beginners only** i.e. suitable for the level of coders up to the end of the FAC pre-requisites.

Please design workshops and programmes for this repo as facilitated sessions. It may be helpful to include specific questions that will check the participants have understood each section.

Workshops and programmes should be added in a folder of their own, containing (as far as possible) all resources necessary to deliver the content. If you think it necessary, please include notes about delivering the session.

Add a link and description to [workshops](workshops) or [programmes](programmes) so your resource can be found.

To add new content to this repo, please create a PR and assign it to @arrested-developer or the current course facilitator to be merged.
