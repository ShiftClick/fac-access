# Getting Started on Codewars :muscle:

A workshop/meetup specifically geared towards helping applicants with tackling Codewars. 

_There may well be participants who haven't started tackling 'Basic JavaScript', 'Basic Data Structures' or 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' on freeCodeCamp (or who haven't even started writing JS yet). It'll still be worth them following the walkthrough and the slides, but probably encourage them to start with the aforementioned fCC sections before actually trying to solve kata, as they may feel out of their depth._

_For something easier than 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' that will get participants used to writing functions, perhaps give [these JavaScript challenges](https://hackmd.io/445IJxgQQ1S-inNrt7fndw) a try._

### Intro to Codewars :hatching_chick:
- [Here are the slides](https://facresources.com/slides/codewars-intro.html#/)
- [Here's the nicer newer version](https://facresources.com/slides/codewars-intro.html#/)
- I'd recommend jumping to signup :point_down: after the 'What's Kyu?' slide

### Signup :clipboard:
- Worth walking through the signup process on the board, and letting participants follow on their laptops
- Solve signup problem together

## Choosing Kata :sparkles:
- [Slide](https://facresources.com/slides/codewars-intro.html#/4)
- Walkthrough filtering kata by `most completed` and `most popular` etc. Also show how to filter by `kyu` and `language`
- Explain the stats of a kata, like `satisfaction rating`

### Mob programme an 8kyu kata :family:
- Make sure to walkthrough and explain the different parts of the training window, like `Instructions` and `Output`
- Suggestions:

### Kata session :ocean:

- Keep working on 8kyu katas
- Try and have people working in table groups, with a mentor each?
- Then, if people in a group feel like they're ready, can pair up and split off and work on kata without a mentor overseeing
- Similarly, if people feel they're adrift, they can move back to freeCodeCamp and get comfortable with the JS :smile:
